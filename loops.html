<h3>Boolean Data Type</h3>
<p>>A boolean expression (or logical expression) evaluates to one of the two states - True or
    False. Several functions and operations in Python return boolean objects.This is shown as follows:-

    <br>
    Note:- Here True and False are Reserved keywords. ie They are not written as "True" or
    "False", as then they will be taken as strings and not boolean values.
    <br>
    Also, note the keywords True and False must have an Upper Case first letter. Using a
    lowercase true or false will return an error.

<h3>Relational Operators</h3>
<p>The operators which compare the values of their operands are called comparison/
    relational operators.</p>

          border:1px solid black;
        }
        </style>
        <body>
        
        <table style="width:100%">
          <tr>
            <th>Operator</th>
            <th>Description</th>
            <th>Example</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>==</td>
            <td>If the values of two operands are equal, then thecondition is true, otherwise, it is false.Common Mistake:- Do not confuse it with the Assignment.
                Operator(=).</td>
            <td>(X == Y) is false</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>!=</td>
            <td>If the values of the two operands are not equal, then the condition is true.</td>
            <td>(X != Y) is true.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
              <td>></td>
              <td>If the value of the left operand is greater than the value of the right operand, then the condition is true.</td>
              <td>(X > Y) is false</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
              <td><</td>
              <td>If the value of the left operand is less than the value of the right operand, then the condition is true.</td>
              <td>(X < Y) is true</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
              <td>>=</td>
              <td>If the value of the left operand is greater than or equal to the value of the right operand, then the condition is true.</td>
              <td>(X >= Y) is false.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
              <td><=</td>
              <td>If the value of the left operand is less than or equal to the value of the right operand, then the condition is true.</td>
              <td>(X <= Y) is true</td>
          </tr>
        </table>

<h3>Logical Operatos</h3>
<p>The operators which act on one or two boolean values and return another boolean value 
    are called logical operators.</p>
    <style>
        table, th, td {
          border:1px solid black;
        }
        </style>
        <body>
        
        <table style="width:100%">
          <tr>
            <td>and</td>
            <td>Logical AND: If both the operands are true then the condition is true.</td>
            <td>(X and Y) is false</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
              <td>or</td>
              <td>Logical OR: If any of the two operands are then the condition is true.</td>
              <td>(X or Y) is true</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
              <td>not</td>
              <td>Logical NOT: Used to reverse the logical state of its operand.</td>
              <td>Not(X) is false</td>
          </tr>
        </table>

<h3>Else-If statements</h3>
<p>The simple if statement, tells us that if a condition is true it will execute a block of
    statements, and if the condition is false it wonâ€™t. But what if we want some other block of
    code to be executed if the condition is false. Here comes the else statement. We can use
    the else statement with if statement to execute a block of code when the condition is
    false.

<h3>If-Elif-Else statements</h3>
<p>So far we have looked at Simple If and a single If-Else statement. However, imagine a
    situation in which if a condition is satisfied, we want a particular block of code to be
    executed, and if some other condition is fulfilled we want some other block of code to run.
    However, if none of the conditions is fulfilled, we want some third block of code to be
    executed. In this case, we use an if-elif-else ladder.
