    <h1>INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON <img src="https://www.321webmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Python-language-symbol.jpg" id="img1"></h1>
    <hr>
    <p>python is an easy-to-learn and a powerful Object-Oriented Programming language. It is a very high-level programming language.</p>
    <h3>Why Python?</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <b>Easy to Use:</b> Python is comparatively an easier-to-use language as compared to other programming languages.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Expressive Language:</b> The syntax of Python is closer to how you would write pseudocode. Which makes it capable of expressing the code’s purpose better than many other languages.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Interpreted Language:</b> Python is an interpreted language; this means that the Python installation interprets and executes the code a line-at-a-time.
        </li>
        <li>
            Python is one of the most popular programming languages to be used in <b>Web Development</b> owing to the variety of Web Development platforms built over it like Django, Flask, etc.
        </li>
    </ol></p>
    <h3>
        Python Download
    </h3>
    <p>
        The very first step towards Python Programming would be to download the tools required to run the Python language. We will be using Python 3 for the course. You can download the latest version of Python 3 from <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">https://www.python.org/downloads/</a>
    </p>
    <h3>
        First Program in Python
    </h3>
    <p>
        <b>In[] : print(&lt;Objects&gt;)</b>
            <br>
        <b>Example</b>If we want to print “Hello, World!” in our code, we will write it in the following way:-
        <br>
        <b>In[] : print(<mark>"Hello, World!"</mark>)</b>
        <br>
        <br>

    </p>
    <fieldset>
    <table>
    <td><b>Question 1:</b></td>
    <td>What will the following code segment print?
    <br>
    print(“Career”)<br>
    print(“Labs”)
    </td>
    <td>
    <abv title="Career Labs"><input type="text" value="Solution" disabled></abv>
    </td>
</table>
    </fieldset>
<h3>
    VARIABLES
</h3>
<P>
    A variable in Python represents a named location that refers to value and whose values can
be used and processed during the program run. In other words, variables are labels/names
to which we can assign value and use them as a reference to that value throughout the
code.
</P>
<header>
    How are Values Assigned to A Variable?
</header>
<p>
    Values are assigned to a variable using a special symbol “=”, called the assignment
operator. An operator is a symbol, like = or +, that performs some operation on one or
more values. For example, the + operator takes two numbers, one to the left of the
operator and one to the right, and adds them together. Likewise, the “=” operator takes a
value to the right of the operator and assigns it to the name/label/variable on the left of the
operator.
<br>
<b>For Example:</b> Now let us create a variable namely Student to hold a student’s name and a
variable Age to hold a student’s age.
<br>
<b>>>> Student = "Jacob"<br>
    >>> Age = 19
</b>
<header>
    Naming a Variable
</header>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Variable names can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.</li>
        <li>They cannot contain spaces.</li>
        <li>Variable names cannot start with a number.</li>
        <li>Variable names are case sensitive. For example:- The variable names Temp and temp are different.</li>
        <li>While writing a program, creating self-explanatory variable names help a lot in increasing the readability of the code. However, too long names can clutter up the program and make it difficult to read.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<header>Python Variables in Memory</header>
<p>
    Python variables are not created in the form most other programming languages do. These variables do not have fixed locations, unlike other languages. The locations they refer/point to changes every time their value changes.Python preloads some commonly used values in an area of memory. This memory space has values/literals at defined memory locations and all these locations have different addresses.
    <br>
    When we give the command, Age = 20, the variable Age is created as a label pointing to a memory location where 20 is already stored. If 20 is not present in any of the memory locations, then 20 is stored in an empty memory location with a unique address and then the Age is made to point to that memory location.
    <br>
    Now, when we give the second command, Age = 30, the label Age will not have the same location as earlier. Now it will point to a memory location where 30 is stored. So this time the memory location for the label Age is changed.

<h3>
    DATA-TYPES
</h3>
<P>
    Data types are the classification or categorization of data items. Data types
represent a kind of value that determines what operations can be performed on
that data. Numeric, non-numeric, and Boolean (true/false) data are the most used
data types. However, each programming language has its classification largely
reflecting its programming philosophy. Python offers the following built-in data
types:
</P>
<UL>
    <LI>Numbers</LI>
    <UL>
    <LI>Floating Point Numbers</LI>
    <LI>Integers</LI>
    <LI>Complex Numbers</LI>
    </UL>
    <LI>Strings
    </LI>
    <LI>Boolean Values
    </LI>
    <LI>
        List, Tuple, and Dictionary
    </LI>
</UL>

<h3>
    Arithmetic Operators in Python
</h3>
<div id="ao" style="display: flex;">
<div style="background-color: red;">
<img src="https://www.engineeringbigdata.com/wp-content/uploads/python-arithmetic-operators.jpg" style="height:100%; width: 100%;">
</div>
<div style="width:50%; border:5px solid purple">
    <p>
    Let us see how these operators work:-<br>
In[] : print(5 + 2) # Addition<br>
Out[] : 7<br>
In[] : print(5 - 2) # Subtraction<br>
Out[] : 3<br>
In[] : print(5 * 2) # Multiplication<br>
Out[] : 10<br>
In[] : print(5 / 2) # Floating Point Division<br>
Out[] : 2.5<br>
In[] : print(5 // 2) # Floor Division<br>
Out[] : 2 # 5 divided by 2 gives 2.5 and value of floor(2.5) is 2<br>
In[] : print(5 ** 2) # Calculate Exponent<br>
Out[] : 25 # 5 raised to the power of 2 is 25<br>
In[] : print(5 % 2) # Modulus<br>
Out[] : 1 # Remainder 1 is left after dividing 5 by 2<br>
</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3>
    How to take User Input?
</h3>
<p style="width:60%; vertical-align: top;">
    To get the input from the user interactively, we can use the built-in function, input(). This
function is used in the following manner:<br>
<b>variable_to_hold_the_input_value = input(Prompt to be displayed)</b>
<br>
<p style="display: inline-block;">
<b>
Let us take an example:-<br>
In[] : age= int(input("Enter Your Age: "))<br>
Enter Your Age: 19<br>
In[] : age<br>
Out[] : 19<br>
Here, the output will be 19 and not '19', i.e. the output is an Integer and not a String<br>.
Similarly, if we want to read a floating-point number, we can do the following:-<br>
In[] : weight= float(input("Enter Your Age: "))<br>
Enter Your Weight: 65.5<br>
In[] : weight<br>
Out[] : 65.5<br>
</b>
</p>
<p style="display:inline-block; width: 30%; background-color: skyblue; position: absolute; right:0px;">
    Note:- input() function always returns a value of the String type. Notice that in the
above script the output for both name and age, Python has enclosed the output in quotes,
like 'Rishabh' and '19', which implies that it is of String type. This is just because,
whatever the user inputs in the input() function, it is treated as a String. This would
mean that even if we input an integer value like 20, it will be treated like a string '19' and
not an integer. Now, we will see how to read Numbers in the next section
</p>
<table style="display: block;">
    <td>Question 3</td>
    <td>What will be the output of the code if input provided is “abc” and “def”?<br>
        a = int(input())<br>
        b=int(input())<br>
        C = a+b<br>
        print(C)<br></td>
    <td>
        <abv title="Value Error"><input type="text"  value="solution" disabled></abv>
